		<h2>
			<b> About Us: </b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			In today's rapidly growing and truly global software industry,
			success is now more than ever dependent on the quality of the
			software. A good quality product or service leads to satisfied and
			loyal customers, the main ambition of every company. The challenge
			that most IT managers and executives have is common: how to
			effectively test software applications on time and within budget
			while balancing resources? Under the right circumstances, <b>crowdsourcing</b>
			offers a rapid and cost-effective approach to software testing.
			Traditionally, software testing was a neglected afterthought. It was
			a tedious chore for developers once their real work was done and was
			based on a set of formal verification mechanisms that were costly to
			apply. Several trends are changing the perception in favor or crowd
			sourced testing. The advent of web applications, whereby software is
			deployed on the Internet and bugs become apparent very quickly. We
			provide a crowd-based mobile testing community to support mobile
			testing Services.
